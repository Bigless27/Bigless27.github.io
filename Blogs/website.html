<p>My experience of building a personal website was exciting. I honestly could’t wait to edit it every week because of how much fun I was having designing it! I learned a lot about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JQuery from Dev Bootcamp’s phase 0. When I first started out I’ll admit that I was a little overwhelmed with all of these concepts. I would make constant little mistakes at first that would take a long time to identify and fix. Now, I am more adapted at writing the code and debugging.</p>

<p>Only major problems I have had with building my personal website was time boxing myself. I  sometimes would start working on my site at 6pm and the next thing that I know it is 3am in the morning! Even though I accomplished a lot during those times, but unfortunately got a little off topic such as trying to learn how to add games to your website. Although, adding games to your website may improves the user experience, I need to learn a more before about JavaScript before attempting to make my own.</p>

 <p>All in all I really enjoyed building my own personal website and I am proud of what I’ve accomplished so far.</p>
