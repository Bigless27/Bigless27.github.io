      <!--Add Paragraphs here -->
    <p>My first week has been very enjoyable. I am already learning a ton of new information. This week I was introduced to Git and Github. Git uses a version control system and you download it to your computer. Github is a open source online community that you can post your files to and have other people look at them and edit them. Version Control is another cool thing I learned about this week. Essentially what it is is just a great way to keep track of your progress with the use of different saved commits. These commits are like "screenshots" of your work and you are able to navigate back and forth through the commits. This is extremely helpful for fixing bugs in your code which can be hard to identify at times. Being able to work back and forth through the commits makes it easier to identify where your code took a turn for the worst. You can then start from that commit and just build off the previous code that you have entered.
    </p>


    <p>Git also helps you keep track of your code by giving you the ability to title your commits so that you are able to know exactly what you where working on at that point of time in your project. You should use Git Hub to store your code because its stored in the cloud. Meaning that you are able to access it anywhere that has an internet connection. This is useful for two reasons first being that god forbid your computer breaks you are still able to access your code. Second being that if multiple people wanted to look at your code you wouldn't have to spend the time to send it to each person individually you could just give them the link to access your code.
