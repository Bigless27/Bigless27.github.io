    <p>Hey guys, I hope everyone had a great week and got a lot accomplished. This week was our first dive into JavaScript and boy did I learn a lot. There are some similarities between JavaScript and Ruby, but today I am here to talk to you about some differences between the two. Specifically, I will be talking to you guys today about the difference between looping in Ruby and JavaScript. Lets examine a really big difference between Ruby and JavaScript and it has to do with the each/for loop. Below I have provided two example of a Ruby each loop and a JavaScript for loop.

    <p>The Ruby loop as you can see from the example above requires and end statement to close it, while a JavaScript uses a curly bracket to indicate where the code to execute begins and the function ends. Next a Ruby each loop defines a variable using | | syntax, while JavaScript defines a variable after the for statement in parentheses. One of the more important things that you should know about the defined variables in the loop is that they differ between JavaScript and Ruby. In Ruby a variable defined in an each loop will iterate through each value while being evaluated at that index’s vales. In JavaScript the variable will iterate through each value and be evaluated at the value’s index value.
    </p>

    <p>Let’s look at he two examples above and see what they are actually doing. The Ruby example is printing out each element of the array “test.” The JavaScript example is doing the same thing. One difference is in the code block between the two loops. Since the JavaScript for loop is being evaluated at the index you need to print the variable at the index to be able to display every element in the array. This differs from the Ruby example because you can just use the variable to print out the values of the array. Finally, a quick difference to notice between the two statements is how the information is being displayed. In the Ruby example, we are displaying the values with the statement puts, while in the JavaScript example we are displaying the information with a console.log() statement. We place what we want to be displayed inside the console.log() statement.
