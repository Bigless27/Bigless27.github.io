     -My take on the experience of DBC is you get out what you put in. The harder you work the more your able to learn about the material and yourself. The whole experience is dependent on yourself, and DBC will guide you on the path to excel.

My impressions of DBC is that this is going of hard work, but I am excited for the challenge.

I see myself probably asking to many questions. I may run in circles a lot and one thing I'm not afraid of is asking for help when I'm stuck. Also, I love to give and receive feedback and really feel that I can help benefit others and myself through the use of constant feedback.
My expectations of DBC have not changed 
I am ecstatic about participating in this kind of learning environment.
It doesn't make me nervous, but moving away to NY from Michigan may make me a little nervous.
